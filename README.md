- This code implements a command in FiveM (GTA V Multiplayer Mod) that allows a normal player character to “tether” a dog character to themselves with a rope. 
- When the dog player is within a certain radius, the normal player can create a leash and tie it to the dog player. 
- The leash is displayed visually and the dog player is tied to the normal player with a rope animation. 
- The command is mainly used for role-playing scenarios in which, for example, dogs are leashed to their owners. 
- The code also contains a function for removing the leash if it is already active.
