    <h2>Function Description</h2>
    <p>This code implements a command in FiveM (GTA V Multiplayer Mod) that allows a player character to be “tethered” to another player using a rope.<br>
    When another player is within a certain range, the player can create a tether and attach it to the target player.<br>
    The leash is displayed visually and the player is attached to the target player with a rope animation.<br>
    The command is primarily used for role-playing scenarios in which, for example, dogs are leashed to their owners.<br>
    The code also contains a function for removing the leash if it is already active.</p>
