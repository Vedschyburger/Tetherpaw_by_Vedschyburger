This code implements a command in FiveM (GTA V Multiplayer Mod) that allows a player character to be “tethered” to another player using a rope. 
When another player is within a certain range, the player can create a tether and attach it to the target player. 
The leash is displayed visually and the player is attached to the target player with a rope animation. 
The command is primarily used for role-playing scenarios in which, for example, dogs are leashed to their owners. 
The code also contains a function for removing the leash if it is already active.
